## 1. **Turn-Based Mechanics**
1. **No Movement**:
    - Each combat encounter takes place in a fixed location. Characters and enemies are positioned at the start and remain in place throughout the fight.

1. **Multiple Actions Based on Limbs**:
    - **Humanoids**: Characters or enemies with two arms get two actions per turn.
    - **Multi-Limbed Creatures**: For example, a large spider with eight legs could get up to 9 actions per turn; one for each limb (including fangs).
    - **Special Cases**: Creatures like serpents could have actions for their fangs and tail, giving them several actions per turn.

### Example Turn Structure
1. **Initiative Roll**: Determine the order of turns.

2. **Player Turn**:
    - Players take their actions based on their abilities and available actions.

3. **Enemy Turn**:
    - Each enemy takes actions based on the number of limbs or special abilities they have.

### Balancing Considerations
- **Action Economy**: It should be possible to dismember / disable enemy limbs, so that you minimize their amount of actions per turn.
- **Special Abilities**: Some limbs might have special attacks/abilities
### Example Scenario vs opponents
**Humanoid**:
- **Actions**: 2 (one for each arm)
- **Possible Actions**: Attack with a weapon, cast a spell, use an item.

**Arachnid**:
- **Actions**: 9 (one for each leg; fangs & stinger)
- **Possible Actions**: Bite, leg swipes, web (entrapment).

**Serpent**:
- **Actions**: 2 (fangs and tail)
- **Possible Actions**: Bite with venom, tail whip.
## 2. **Stats & Modifiers**
- **Core Stats**: 
	- Health
	- Attack
	- Armor
	- Accuracy (hit chance)
		- modified by enemy buffs/debuffs, the accessibility of the targeted limb etc.)
	- Evasion (dodge chance)
		- another modifier akin to hit chance, but defensively)
	- Luck (critical hit chance) 
		- modified by targeting weak / strong areas.
- **Boons and Banes**
	- Characters can acquire positive traits (Boons) and negative traits (Banes) that affect their stats and performance in combat.
	    - **Boons**
		    - Examples include increased critical hit chance, faster healing, or enhanced defense.
	    - **Banes** 
		    - Examples include reduced accuracy, increased damage taken, or slower speed.
- **Fears (Phobias)**
	- Characters can develop fears that affect their performance against certain enemy types or in specific conditions.
    - **Examples**: Necrophobia (fear of undead), Teraphobia (fear of monsters), Claustrophobia (fear of confined spaces).

## 3. **Class Proficiencies & Skills**
- **Class System**: Each character class has proficiency with certain weapons, armor and skills.
    - **Examples**: Warriors excel with melee weapons, Mages with spells, Archers with ranged attacks.
- **Skill Variety**: Each class has a unique set of skills that can be used in combat, with some skills being more effective against certain enemy types.
    - **Examples**: A Mage’s fire spell might be particularly effective against undead, while a Warrior’s shield bash could stun humanoid enemies.

## 4. **Enemy Strengths & Weaknesses**
- **Enemy Types**: Different enemies have specific weaknesses and strengths that players must exploit to succeed.
    - **Examples**: Undead might be weak to holy attacks but resistant to poison, while beasts could be vulnerable to fire but strong against physical attacks.
- **Strategic Combat**: Players must analyze each enemy encounter and adjust their tactics accordingly. Brute forcing the same strategy as a previous, different enemy can be a valid approach but is never the most effective.
## 5. **Combat Engagement**
- **Dismemberment and Targeting**: Inspired by “Fear and Hunger,” players can target specific body parts of enemies to disable certain attacks or abilities.
    - **Examples**: Targeting an enemy’s arm to prevent it from using a powerful weapon, or aiming for the legs to reduce its mobility.
- **Fortitude, Sati and **: Characters must manage their fortitude, hunger and thirst levels, which can affect their performance in combat.
    - **Fortitude**: Low fortitude can lead to erratic behaviour or even refusal to follow commands.
    - **Hunger**: Characters must eat to maintain their strength; hunger can reduce stats and effectiveness in battle.

## 6. **Randomization & Replayability**
- **Rogue-lite Elements**: Each playthrough features randomized elements such as enemy placements, loot, and environmental conditions.
- **Modifiers**: Stats and modifiers can change with each playthrough, ensuring a unique experience every time. Different boons/banes, different phobias, different routes

### Example Combat Scenario
1. **Turn Order**: The turn order is determined by Speed; a fast character moves before a slow character. 
	1. Enemies are also factored in here; quick and nimble can potentially act before the player, and slow and hard hitting enemies acts after.
2. **Actions**: The Rogue uses a skill to target an enemy’s weakspot, the Warrior uses a shield bash to daze the enemy, and the enemy targets one of the party members to attack them, prioritizing on the 'ideal' target based on difficulty modifier.
3. **Strategic Decisions**: The player must decide whether to focus on dismembering a powerful enemy’s limbs or to manage the party’s fortitude and sati levels during the fight.
