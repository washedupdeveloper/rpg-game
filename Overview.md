## Classes
### [[Warrior]]
A melee focused all round class that has a great balance of health and damage. Primarily acts as the physical damage dealer and or tank of the party.
High defense, stronger to attacks than the rest of the party members, but also less nimble.
### [[Rogue]]
A melee/ranged class
Medium defense, weaker but more nimble than the warrior. 
### [[Spellcaster]]
A magician that casts spells of different elements/kinds. 
Light defense, so more susceptible to physical damage than the rogue
### [[Apothecary]]
A support that creates mixtures of potions to either aid party members or ail the enemy. Light defense, so similarly susceptible to damage as the spellcaster.
